			<p class="description-para">See how the planets of our solar system compare, size-wise, to our Sun. Mercury is smallest, followed by Mars, Venus, Earth, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter. (Pluto has been reclassified as a dwarf planet, and no longer makes the list.)</p>
			<p class="description-para">The Sun is the background, with the planets drawn to scale on top. The four small planets are mostly rock, with thin, wispy atmospheres. The big planets are gas giants, mostly hydrogen and helium. Jupiter is by far the largest planet of our solar systemâ€”1321 Earths could fit inside it. But even Jupiter is dwarfed by the Sun, which could hold 1.3 million Earths.</p>
