			<p class="description-para">The amount of sea ice and snow cover varies with the seasons over the course of a year. This map shows that variation between September 2005 and September 2006. Because Earth’s polar regions amplify the effects of climate change, scientists track year-to-year variations in the ice and snow cover.</p>

			<h1 class="infoTitle">What do the colors mean?</h1>
				<p class="infoText">The bright white surfaces of snow and ice reflect sunlight back to space. But as snow and ice melt, the darker surfaces of land and oceans absorb sunlight instead of reflecting it—which causes additional warming. Models agree that, as the global temperature rises, the sea ice will melt, but snow cover predictions are trickier. Warming could increase snow melt and decrease the amount of new snow, or it could cause an increase in precipitation amounts in high latitudes. Research continues.</p>
