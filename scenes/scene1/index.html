			<p class="description-para">The world's 9,000 or so civil airports are busy places. At any given moment, roughly 5,000 planes are in the skies above the United States, and American controllers handle an average of 64 million takeoffs and landings each year. But Asia is becoming one of the most important markets for domestic and international travel.</p>
